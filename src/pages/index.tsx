          The internet is without a doubt the most important technological development in human history. The rate of technological development is accelerating exponentially. What previously took a decade will now take 6 months or less. Mass adoption of AI,  Web3, and the metaverse is just around the corner. It will expand the internet as we know it by introducing novel features and advancements. The next generation of internet application development will use all aspects of modern technology, including AI, 3D, VR, AR, blockchain, cloud and edge computing, voice computing, ambient computing, and more.

          As the pace of technological change accelerates, big players like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and OpenAI will win by providing infrastructure, large AI foundation models, frameworks, 3D Metaverse base experiences, and massive distribution networks. Solopreneurs trained in this program will win by automating work typically outsourced to employees, by directly connecting to customers by eliminating the middleman, and by developing vertical metaverses, thus paving the way for the first <b>  billion-dollar valued solopreneur businesses.</b> This program has the objective to train this new breed of billion-dollar solopreneurs. These solopreneurs will adopt the ultra-lean business model and work independently and will not need to hire employees or other team members.

          Recently developed generative platforms for artificial intelligence like ChatGPT, and Amazonâ€™s Bedrock will serve as a base upon which various internet apps will be developed, upending the entire software industry. We must consider these new generative AI systems as a new kind of operating systems, rather than software, upon which internet applications will be created.

          Most businesses want to employ these enormous generative language models in developing their apps, but training them costs billions of dollars and takes years, and most businesses don't want to go through that. So what they want to do is work off of a foundational model (FM) that's already big and great and then customize it for their own purposes. We will learn to do exactly that in this course and integrate them into the Internet apps we built. Startup enterprises, particularly those with limited resources, will be able to bring their products to market more rapidly and efficiently with the support of these FMs.

          Web3 and Metaverse are also moving at a breakneck speed. Citi is the latest Wall Street business to give a positive prognosis for Web 3.0 and the Metaverse, terms used to depict a future internet vision centered on decentralized technologies and virtual worlds. Citi stated in a March 2022 research paper that the metaverse economy might have a total addressable market of up to $13 trillion and five billion people by 2030. We will also learn to integrate these
